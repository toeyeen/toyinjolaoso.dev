excerpt: After an extended hiatus from academic learning, I recently completed my BCS exams with a renewed sense of purpose. With a focus on foundational concepts, the exam modules of Computer Networks and Technology, Software Development, and Information Systems tested my knowledge and skills. Supported by a tutorial class and armed with effective study techniques, I approached the exams confidently, aiming for success.

I recently completed my BCS exams (British Computer Society, The Chartered Institute of IT) after being out of touch with academic learning for over 8 years. It's been a long time since I engaged in retentive learning, with my last experience being during my final university paper in 2015. The exam comprised three different modules: Computer Networks and Technology, Software Development, and Information Systems. Among these, I was particularly familiar with the Software Development module due to my professional background. Software development is something I enjoy, and I am deeply immersed in it on a daily basis. Luckily, the exam focused on foundational concepts, making it relatively easy for me.

To ensure accountability and maintain my dedication to studying, I chose to join a tutorial class. Without the support of my instructor and classmates, I don't think I would have approached the exam with the same level of seriousness. I took on the role of tutoring the Software Development module to some of my colleagues who were struggling with complex ideas. On the other hand, the Computer Networks and Technology module proved to be less engaging and challenging for the entire class. Even the instructor struggled with teaching this abstract topic, which delved into program counters, instruction registers, OSI Models and the exponential growth of transistors (as per Moore's law). But enough about the less exciting aspects. Let's focus on why we're here and how I approached my exam preparation.

Throughout my life, I have instinctively employed various reading techniques and study habits, but I never realized they had specific names until I stumbled upon an Instagram post by an Asian lady. Her insights made me more conscious of these techniques, and today I want to share them with my wonderful audience to help them excel in their exams.

P.S. While the exam results are not yet available, I am confident that I performed quite well. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

### Active recalls

Sure, here are some active recall techniques that you can use for studying and memorizing for exams:

1. **Feynman Technique**: This technique involves writing down concepts in your own words. It helps you understand the material better and identify gaps in your knowledge.
2. **Flashcards**: Flashcards are a classic active recall technique. They allow you to test yourself on specific information and reinforce your memory of concepts.
3. **Practice Questions**: Practice questions are an excellent way to test your understanding of a topic. They also help you identify areas where you need to improve.
4. **Teach Someone**: Teaching someone else what you've learned is a great way to reinforce your understanding of the material. It also helps you identify gaps in your knowledge.
5. **Summarize**: Summarizing the material in your own words is an effective way to reinforce your understanding and identify gaps in your knowledge.

### Spaced repetition

Here are some spaced repetition techniques that can be useful for studying:

1. **Leitner System**: This system involves using flashcards and dividing them into different boxes based on how well you know the material. Cards you know well are moved to a box you review less frequently, while cards you struggle with are moved to a box you review more frequently.
2. **Pomodoro Technique**: This technique involves breaking up study sessions into shorter intervals with breaks in between. This helps keep you focused and prevents burnout.
3. **Retrieval Practice**: This technique involves testing yourself on the material at spaced intervals. This can be done with flashcards, practice questions, or other active recall techniques.
4. **Spacing Effect**: This effect suggests that spacing out your study sessions over a longer period of time can be more effective than cramming all at once. It allows your brain to consolidate and reinforce the material over time.

### Memorizing techniques

Here are some memorization techniques that you can use for studying and preparing for exams:

1. **Acronyms**: Acronyms are a useful way to remember a list of items or concepts. You can create an acronym by taking the first letter of each item and creating a word or phrase from those letters.
2. **Acrostics**: An acrostic is similar to an acronym, but instead of creating a word, you create a sentence using the first letter of each item or concept you want to remember. The sentence should be easy to remember and should help you recall the items or concepts.
3. **Mnemonic Devices**: Mnemonic devices are memory aids that help you remember information through association. For example, you can use a rhyme or song to remember a list of items or concepts.
4. **Visualization**: Visualization involves creating mental images to help you remember information. You can create a mental image that represents the information you want to remember, or you can create a story that incorporates the information.
5. **Chunking**: Chunking involves breaking up information into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can make it easier to remember and can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by large amounts of information.

As I said earlier, You can see the fancy and eccentric names here and some of the things listed are actions we take and are familiar with.  Fret not, we got this and I am sure if you take cognisance of these things and actively apply them you will see a turnaround in how you remember things. Bye for now see you guys in the next post.
