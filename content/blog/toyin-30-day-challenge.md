Two days to my birthday and I am uninterested about a lot of things, while a little stereotypical for this time of year, rather than making some large overtures regarding my goals for 2023, I'm going to simply get started on things that are important to me. So instead of sitting here meticulously planning out how I'm going to accomplish XYZ goals, I'm going to do the opposite and simply execute on what I'm dubbing the Toyin's 30 Day Challenge.

## What is the Toyin's 30 day challenge?

It is a challenge to dive headfirst into things that I've always valued but never consistently put time towards.

## Rules

1. Spend at least 30 minutes on each activity a day.
1. Each activity must be recorded in a log to show some type of progress no matter how imperfect it is.

## Activities

- **Write**: Write a short and concise article
- **Read** - Read at least a chapter a day
- **Exercise** - Complete my exercise ring on my Apple Watch
- **Code** - Finish two coding challenge on leetcode
- **Typing** - Spend at least 30 mins on Typingclub or keybr.

## Final Thoughts

I'll create a place to record my outcomes for each day, but at the bare minimum, I promise to post a summary of what happened when this month ends.

And with that, off to the next activity!
