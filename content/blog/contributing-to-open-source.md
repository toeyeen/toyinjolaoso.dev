excerpt: In this blog post, I want to share a valuable approach to effectively communicate suggestions and pain points in a new working environment. Whether it's at work, in an open-source project, or within a community, conveying your ideas in a clear and concise manner is crucial for them to be considered. Through my own experience, I have developed an approach with a success rate of around 95%..

This is the very first writing that I have not been forced to do, in one way or the other either be it a school project, monetary reasons, visa statement of purpose or exam. I see all these as motives for writing, but today I will say that I am writing because I want to educate other young developers and get better at writing. There is a purpose behind it  This is a huge milestone for me. I am not much of a writer, all my life I have always found a  way to distance myself from writing because of this I opted to do engineering coupled with some other funny and interesting reasons but it is a story for another day. Let's get right into what this blog is about.

Are you in a new working environment?  It could be work, open source, or even a simple discord community and you have been giving your suggestions but it does hold water so the facilitators do not consider it. There is a very high chance that this is because of the way you are passing your suggestion across, Today I will show my approach which I can comfortably tell you have a  95% success rate,  ðŸ‘€ I did the calculation myself.

### Steps you take

When suggesting a feature or explaining a pain point it will be great if you can break down your thoughts into different paragraphs. Example.

#### Title

Simple and short Title that explains the issue at hand in one glance

#### Description

Describe the situation, if you encountered a problem describe the use case and how it is a problem to the application e.g As a user when I want to place a bet but it takes me about 5 clicks to get my bet approved, or as a user, I would like to see the deposit page on the first load of the website. These are simple and straightforward examples

#### Examples

You can further give two or three examples depending on the subject topic (It shouldnâ€™t be more than 5), but try as much to give an example. Some people believe examples should be optional but I think it is one of the most important things in the suggestions because it gives the reviewer a clear picture of what you are trying to achieve.

#### Suggestion

 This should contain how you think the task should be solved. Write or express yourself in a way that can easily get suggestions and opinions from your team or other collaborators.

#### Conclusion

A simple and concise conclusion of your problem.

Below is an example further detailing how your can present your suggestion

## Example

### Examine Project

I would like dev tools to examine the project to try to look for best practices and ways to improve my experience. This one might be a little bit more tricky, I think this would useful. Showing ways to better improve the app in general and in performance. The only problem is trying to figure out what's right.

- E.g: If you use SSG over node server you could possibly see a performance increase on average % -%.
- E.g: Instead of usingÂ `thisFunction`Â have you tried possibly making into a composable? You have duplicate code here, here and here. The downside to this is....
- E.g You don't seem to be usingÂ `server/`, it might be optimal to delete this directory until it's used.
- E.g The Nuxt Team prefers usingÂ `....`Â overÂ `....`
- E.g It seems that you using the options api with only one method and data, have you tried using the Composition API to even simply it more ?

The standard is set based on what version of nuxt so then make it easier when people upgrade they can see where functions are deprecated or there is better alternatives.

- **Full Examine**
  - Takes quite a bit longer but can be a button that pressed to then scan the whole repo itself with some progress bar.
- **Quick Examine**Â (Run on start of dev)
  - Maybe it just scan components, pages, endpoints that loaded initially AKA (whatever page they are currently on).

The goal is to show how do best practices, optimize code/quality and performance. This could help people greatly especially for beginners and just old projects migrating to the newer standards of nuxt.
